            <strong>1. WHO WE ARE?</strong>
            <br />

            <p>
                Caracol State Park is a 25.10 hectare conservation unit in the state of
                Rio Grande do Sul, in the municipality of Canela.
            </p>

            <p>
                Its main attraction is a true spectacle of nature: the Caracol
                Waterfall, with a free fall of 131 meters, that can be enjoyed from
                lookouts and the observatory, which provide a privileged panoramic view.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Park was officially founded in 1973, however, since 1954, when the
                Government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul declared public utility the
                land where Caracol Waterfall is located, there has been a gradual
                increase in the number of visitors to the site, which motivated the
                implementation of an infrastructure such as an entrance, restaurant,
                public toilets, indoor parking, and the waterfall observation deck.
                Since December 2022, the Park has been under concession by Consórcio
                Novo Caracol e Tainhas.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to the main services, CARACOL PARK offers walks on
                ecological trails, a train ride through the Estação do Sonho Vivo,
                visits to the Observatory – a lookout point at a height of 27m, with a
                360º view of the park, in addition to the Historic Center, playground,
                sports courts and shops.
